<h1>The Best Movies By Mina Barsoum</h1>

 <p>These are my top 3 movies of all time!</p>

 <hr />

 <h2>Spider-Man</h2>

 <p>
    Need I explain? This is the first super-hero movie of its kind and it still holds up; even the effects were good. And Spider-Man is simply the greatest superhero of all time. But let's not forget the casting of this movie; Willem Dafoe is a legend and kills it as the Green Goblin. I honestly wish we got to see him play the Joker, he's got the perfect amount of crazy for it. But yeah, this movie is amazing and it was made in an area where super-hero movies weren't scared to be campy. It just has its own style that you don't see with movies today.

 <h2>Arrival</h2>

 <p>Made me cry want to cry. What a beautiful take on Aliens and the meaning of life. A genuine masterpiece. If you haven't seen it, please watch it tonight.</p>

 <h2>Soul</h2>

 <p>As a guy who constantly feels late and like I'm waiting for life to get good or for me to get my big moment, this movie made me cry my eyes out. My greatest fear is finding out that I never lived and this movie just wraps all those scary thoughts and emotions revolving around that fear into one nice bundle. It's an adult film disguised as a pixar movie. Please watch and live your life.</p>
